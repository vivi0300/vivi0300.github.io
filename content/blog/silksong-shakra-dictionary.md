# Shakra Dictionary

## Remarks

Everything she says is either an exclamation / noun (e.g. Hello) or idiom (e.g. What the Hell). The phonemes are very klingon-esque in general. Notably, in her most lengthy and sincere dialogue (trail's end and act 3), she barely speaks any of her mother tongue, but she says a lot of new words after fighting with Hornet.
