The phonemes are very klingon-esque in general. Notably, in her most lengthy and sincere dialogue (trail\u0026rsquo;s end and act 3), she barely speaks any of her mother tongue, but she says a lot of new words after fighting with Hornet.\nDefinitions Poshanka a message that says you hope someone is well, happy, etc.:\n\u0026quot;Poshanka! Edges sharp and senses keen!\u0026quot; Gara Takana An expression of usually slight anger or surprise, or a way of adding force to a statement, question, etc.\n\u0026quot;Gara Takana! What has happened to you, Child Wielding Needle\u0026quot; Yakkanesh Used for telling someone to give attention to what they are doing because there is a risk they could have an accident, make a mistake, or damage something:\nYakkanesh! Keep your weapon drawn and your bearings true! Ka, va an expression of disgust (= disapproval and dislike):\nKa, va! Your shell is ridden with those gruesome maggots. Okklu-din used to show that a question is difficult to answer or that the answer is not immediately clear:\nOkklu-Din\u0026hellip; a perceptive question. I travel in search of my mentor, the greatest of my tribe. Peh. Bakallo said when you are answering a polite question or remark:\nCartography! Peh. Bakallo! It is a craft-skill common amongst my tribe. Dondakku to call out to express disapproval or strong disagreement:\nDondakku! Where are the armaments? The watch-poles? Never have I seen such a poorly defended encampment! Yokkala To indicate that you understand what someone is telling you\nYokkala\u0026hellip; Perhaps so. They must have prized indeed the work done here (\u0026hellip;) Nu-Hakkata an idea, something said or written, or behaviour that is silly or stupid:\nNu-Hakkata! Whether she is dead or alive, have faith! Hakk used as an informal greeting between people who know each other or as an expression of approval:\nNeedle Child. Hakk! I encountered a settlement near here (\u0026hellip;) Garrok used for telling people that it is time to start moving or doing something with energy and enthusiasm:\nGarrok! Hornet Wielding Needle. Beside you, I will gladly raise my rings! Bakkana used to emphasize that you strongly agree or disagree, like or dislike something, etc.:\nBakkana! A battle well won! Un-daak used for praising someone for something they have done well:\nUn-Daak\u0026hellip; well struck. To face the fury of your weapon in a true battle would be an experience indeed. Bakelo Yes, certainly:\nBakelo! Answer to your tasks, then. My rings shall await your return. Gendaa Something you say when you are happy because something bad did not happen:\nGendaa\u0026hellip; This is good, Hornet Wielding Needle, essential.
